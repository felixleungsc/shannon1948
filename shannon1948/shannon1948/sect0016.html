<h1 id="a0000000017">14 Discussion</h1>
<p>The demonstration of Theorem&#160;<a href="sect0015.html#thm:11">11</a>, while not a pure existence proof, has some of the deficiencies of such proofs. An attempt to obtain a good approximation to ideal coding by following the method of the proof is generally impractical. In fact, apart from some rather trivial cases and certain limiting situations, no explicit description of a series of approximation to the ideal has been found. Probably this is no accident but is related to the difficulty of giving an explicit construction for a good approximation to a random sequence. </p>
<p>An approximation to the ideal would have the property that if the signal is altered in a reasonable way by the noise, the original can still be recovered. In other words the alteration will not in general bring it closer to another reasonable signal than the original. This is accomplished at the cost of a certain amount of redundancy in the coding. The redundancy must be introduced in the proper way to combat the particular noise structure involved. However, any redundancy in the source will usually help if it is utilized at the receiving point. In particular, if the source already has a certain redundancy and no attempt is made to eliminate it in matching to the channel, this redundancy will help combat noise. For example, in a noiseless telegraph channel one could save about 50% in time by proper encoding of the messages. This is not done and most of the redundancy of English remains in the channel symbols. This has the advantage, however, of allowing considerable noise in the channel. A sizable fraction of the letters can be received incorrectly and still reconstructed by the context. In fact this is probably not a bad approximation to the ideal in many cases, since the statistical structure of English is rather involved and the reasonable English sequences are not too far (in the sense required for the theorem) from a random selection. </p>
<p>As in the noiseless case a delay is generally required to approach the ideal encoding. It now has the additional function of allowing a large sample of noise to affect the signal before any judgment is made at the receiving point as to the original message. Increasing the sample size always sharpens the possible statistical assertions. </p>
<p>The content of Theorem&#160;<a href="sect0015.html#thm:11">11</a> and its proof can be formulated in a somewhat different way which exhibits the connection with the noiseless case more clearly. Consider the possible signals of duration \(T\) and suppose a subset of them is selected to be used. Let those in the subset all be used with equal probability, and suppose the receiver is constructed to select, as the original signal, the most probable cause from the subset, when a perturbed signal is received. We define \(N(T,q)\) to be the maximum number of signals we can choose for the subset such that the probability of an incorrect interpretation is less than or equal to \(q\). </p>

  </div>
</div>
<p>In other words, no matter how we set out limits of reliability, we can distinguish reliably in time \(T\) enough messages to correspond to about \(CT\) bits, when \(T\) is sufficiently large. Theorem&#160;<a href="sect0016.html#thm:12">12</a> can be compared with the definition of the capacity of a noiseless channel given in Section&#160;1. </p>
