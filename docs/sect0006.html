<h1 id="a0000000007">5 Ergodic and Mixed Sources</h1>
<p> As we have indicated above a discrete source for our purposes can be considered to be represented by a Markoff process. Among the possible discrete Markoff processes there is a group with special properties of significance in communication theory. This special class consists of the “ergodic” processes and we shall call the corresponding sources ergodic sources. Although a rigorous definition of an ergodic process is somewhat involved, the general idea is simple. In an ergodic process every sequence produced by the process is the same in statistical properties. Thus the letter frequencies, digram frequencies, etc., obtained from particular sequences, will, as the lengths of the sequences increase, approach definite limits independent of the particular sequence. Actually this is not true of every sequence but the set for which it is false has probability zero. Roughly the ergodic property means statistical homogeneity. </p>
<p>All the examples of artificial languages given above are ergodic. This property is related to the structure of the corresponding graph. If the graph has the following two properties<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000040">
  <sup class="footnotemark">1</sup>
</a> the corresponding process will be ergodic: </p>
<ol class="enumerate">
  <li><p>The graph does not consist of two isolated parts A and B such that it is impossible to go from junction points in part A to junction points in part B along lines of the graph in the direction of arrows and also impossible to go from junctions in part B to junctions in part A. </p>
</li>
  <li><p>A closed series of lines in the graph with all arrows on the lines pointing in the same orientation will be called a “circuit.” The “length” of a circuit is the number of lines in it. Thus in Fig.&#160;<a href="sect0006.html#fig:5">5</a> series BEBES is a circuit of length 5. The second property required is that the greatest common divisor of the lengths of all circuits in the graph be one. </p>
</li>
</ol>

</figure>
<p>If the first condition is satisfied but the second one violated by having the greatest common divisor equal to \(d{\gt}1\), the sequences have a certain type of periodic structure. The various sequences fall into \(d\) different classes which are statistically the same apart from a shift of the origin (i.e., which letter in the sequence is called letter 1). By a shift of from 0 up to \(d-1\) any sequence can be made statistically equivalent to any other. A simple example with \(d=2\) is the following: There are three possible letters \(a,b,c\). Letter \(a\) is followed with either \(b\) or \(c\) with probabilities \(\frac13\) and \(\frac23\) respectively. Either \(b\) or \(c\) is always followed by letter \(a\). Thus a typical sequence is </p>
<div class="displaymath" id="a0000000041">
  \[  \text{\itshape a b a c a c a c a b a c a b a b a c a c}.  \]
</div>
<p> This type of situation is not of much importance for our work. </p>
<p>If the first condition is violated the graph may be separated into a set of subgraphs each of which satisfies the first condition. We will assume that the second condition is also satisfied for each subgraph. We have in this case what may be called a “mixed” source made up of a number of pure components. The components correspond to the various subgraphs. If \(L_1\), \(L_2\), \(L_3,\dots \) are the component sources we may write </p>
<div class="displaymath" id="a0000000042">
  \[  L = p_1 L_1 + p_2 L_2 + p_3 L_3 + \dotsb  \]
</div>
<p> where \(p_i\) is the probability of the component source \(L_i\). </p>
<p>Physically the situation represented is this: There are several different sources \(L_1\), \(L_2\), \(L_3,\dots \) which are each of homogeneous statistical structure (i.e., they are ergodic). We do not know <em>a priori</em> which is to be used, but once the sequence starts in a given pure component \(L_i\), it continues indefinitely according to the statistical structure of that component. </p>
<p>As an example one may take two of the processes defined above and assume \(p_1 = .2\) and \(p_2 = .8\). A sequence from the mixed source </p>
<div class="displaymath" id="a0000000043">
  \[  L=.2 L_1 + .8L_2  \]
</div>
<p> would be obtained by choosing first \(L_1\) or \(L_2\) with probabilities .2 and .8 and after this choice generating a sequence from whichever was chosen. </p>
<p>Except when the contrary is stated we shall assume a source to be ergodic. This assumption enables one to identify averages along a sequence with averages over the ensemble of possible sequences (the probability of a discrepancy being zero). For example the relative frequency of the letter A in a particular infinite sequence will be, with probability one, equal to its relative frequency in the ensemble of sequences. </p>
<p>If \(P_i\) is the probability of state \(i\) and \(p_i(j)\) the transition probability to state \(j\), then for the process to be stationary it is clear that the \(P_i\) must satisfy equilibrium conditions: </p>
<div class="displaymath" id="a0000000044">
  \[  P_j = \sum _i P_i p_i (j).  \]
</div>
<p> In the ergodic case it can be shown that with any starting conditions the probabilities \(P_j(N)\) of being in state \(j\) after \(N\) symbols, approach the equilibrium values as \(N\to \infty \). </p>
